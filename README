Plack-InitScript

Plack is great to develop for, but unfortunately it has no easy init script.

This project is aimed at writing a portable, universal, configurable
init V script for multiple Plack-based services once and for all.

So the usage should be like:

  sudo service plack start foo

or just

  sudo service plack restart

The module, Plack::InitScript, covers configuration loading and validation,
while the heavy lifting is offloaded to Daemon::Control.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
