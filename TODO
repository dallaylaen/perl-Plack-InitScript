Plack::InitScript roadmap.

# Alpha:

* Write LSB-conpatible init script, recognized by service(8) command
* Run script on different Linuxes
* Run script on FreeBSD

# Beta:

* Write robust tempdir-based tests (cover: sub=100%, stmt >= 90%)
* Strict validation:
    - allow no unknown options in config
    - allow no unknown options in apps
    - require all but port/alias/path covered in defaults section
* Scripts & tests -T mode
* Configurable signal (Plack wants QUIT but D::C sends TERM)

# Further development

* List configured apps
* Validate configuration (w/o running stuff or dying)
* Stop/status correctly even if config broken.
* Check applications for consistency (perl -we 'ref (do shift) eq "CODE";')
* Ping applications if special URL given
* Make ping and validation async (AnyEvent?)
